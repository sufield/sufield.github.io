        <p>On February 1, 2003, Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry, killing all seven astronauts aboard. The cause? A piece of foam insulation that struck the wing during launch.</p>

              Unvalidated Assumptions Destroy Systems

<p>But here's what makes this relevant to every cloud provider today: <strong>NASA knew foam shedding happened</strong>. They'd seen it on dozens of previous flights. The unspoken assumption was that it was &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;acceptable.&quot;</p>
<h2>The Invisible Invariant</h2>
<p>NASA's implicit invariant was: &quot;Foam strikes during launch are common and non-fatal.&quot; This assumption was never formally validated. It was just... accepted. Over time, the organization normalized this deviance.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<h2>Cloud Providers in 2025: The Same Pattern</h2>
<p>Every major cloud provider has their own &quot;foam shedding&quot; — small configuration drifts, deployment timing assumptions, internal service dependencies that work &quot;most of the time.&quot;</p>
<p>The Cloudflare outage in November 2025? An unspoken assumption about edge propagation timing. The CrowdStrike incident in July 2024? An implicit invariant about config validation that was &quot;known but accepted.&quot;</p>
<h2>The Discipline Gap</h2>
<p>After Challenger and Columbia, NASA implemented formal requirement that <strong>every assumption must be explicitly modeled and continuously validated</strong>. Not checked once. Not assumed safe. <strong>Continuously proven safe</strong>.</p>
<p>The space industry learned this lesson at the cost of 14 lives.</p>
<p>The cloud industry is learning it at the cost of billions in revenue and trust — one cascading outage at a time.</p>
<h2>What Would It Take?</h2>
<p>Aviation eliminated this class of failure by making implicit invariants impossible. Every assumption is codified. Every state transition is verified. Every configuration change is proven safe before it reaches production.</p>
<p>The technology exists. The discipline exists. The precedent exists.</p>

        <p>What we lack is the willingness to admit that &quot;it usually works&quot; is not engineering — it's gambling.</p>
