Observability has given teams rich dashboards, traces, logs, and metrics. These
tools are excellent for seeing what is happening and understanding why something
broke. They are not designed to enforce safety automatically.

              Watching Problems Happen Is Not Prevention

In many organizations, the loop looks like this:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Something goes wrong in production.</li>
  <li>Dashboards clearly show the problem.</li>
  <li>Alerts page someone who is already overloaded.</li>
  <li>Human action eventually stabilizes the system.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The system is still relying on a person to interpret data and decide how to react.
The distance between seeing a problem and acting on it creates long, painful
incident timelines.
</p>

<p>
Adding more charts and alerts does not change this dynamic. The missing element
is a component that can treat observability signals as input for automated
runtime decisions, not just as information for humans to read.

        <p>
RCP exists to turn observability into controlled, automatic reactions instead of
leaving all action to manual incident response.
