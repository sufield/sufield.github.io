        <p>
Teams invest heavily in CI/CD, testing, and rollout strategies. Pipelines prove that
a change can be deployed, not that it will remain safe once it is exposed to real
traffic and real failure modes.

              Safety Ends at Deployment — Risk Begins

<p>
The moment code is live, it meets unpredictable load, real user behavior, noisy
dependencies, and partial failures. The risk profile changes continuously, but most
systems still behave as if safety was a one-time event finished at deployment time.
</p>

<p>
Symptoms show up everywhere:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A canary looks healthy at rollout, then degrades 20 minutes later.</li>
  <li>Traffic shifts succeed technically but overload downstream services.</li>
  <li>Latency creeps up slowly until SLOs burn and alerts fire too late.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Monitoring and alerts help us see these problems, but they do not own responsibility
for keeping the change safe. No standard runtime safety layer exists to watch
deployed changes and react automatically when conditions drift.

RCP was built to close this gap and make safety after deployment a first-class concern.
