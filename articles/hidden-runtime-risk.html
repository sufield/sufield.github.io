        <p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Modern systems change shape during runtime. Traffic shifts, retries spike, caches stall, dependencies slow down. These shifts create <strong>unsafe states</strong> that no deployment tool or static config change can see.</p>

              Runtime Risk Is Invisible Until It Explodes

<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>
Failures start long before an outage. Small drifts accumulate until the system crosses a boundary that no human is watching. These conditions are invisible in dashboards and logs.</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
Teams treat incidents as surprises because the system had no mechanism to declare, "I am no longer safe."</p>

        <p><strong>Insight:</strong><br>
Runtime risk must be monitored as a <strong>first-class state</strong>, not as a side effect of metrics or Git diffs.</p>
