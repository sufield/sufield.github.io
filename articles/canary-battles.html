        <p><strong>Problem:</strong><br>
Canaries reduce deployment risk, but they do not detect risks that emerge minutes or hours later—dependency overload, chain reactions, retry storms, or slow degradation.</p>

              Canaries Lie About Long-Term Safety
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        

        
        

<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong><br>
Most outages happen after a "successful" rollout. The canary was narrow; the system interactions were wide.</p>

<p><strong>Impact:</strong><br>
Teams believe the deployment was safe while the system slowly drifts into failure.</p>

        <p><strong>Insight:</strong><br>
Deployment checks are not enough. The system needs <strong>continuous validation</strong> of safety after rollout.</p>
