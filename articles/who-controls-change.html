Rollouts start automatically but usually stop only when a human notices something
is wrong. Once a change is live, there is rarely a clearly defined owner for its
ongoing safety.

              Nobody Owns Runtime Safety
            </p>

<p>
In practice, this means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alerts are noisy and easy to ignore or delay.</li>
  <li>On-call engineers are the last line of defense under pressure.</li>
  <li>Rollbacks happen after users feel the impact, not before.</li>
  <li>
    So-called automatic strategies still depend on humans to design complex
    wiring for every scenario.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
The structural issue is simple. Runtime safety decisions require a combination of:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>metrics that reflect live conditions,</li>
  <li>clear safety boundaries,</li>
  <li>timing and windows,</li>
  <li>scoped reactions that do not punish the entire system.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Most teams do not have the time or appetite to build a dedicated safety engine,
so the problem is pushed to operators and ad-hoc scripts. The result is fragile
and inconsistent runtime control.

RCP was designed to take ownership of these live decisions instead of leaving them to chance.
