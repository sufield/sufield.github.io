When something goes wrong in production, the safest action often seems to be a
full rollback or a complete stop of the rollout. This approach is simple to
reason about but can cause its own form of damage.

              Rollback Cannot Fix Runtime State

<p>
A small hotspot in one region, one subset, or one user segment can trigger a
cluster-wide reversal. Healthy traffic is disturbed, caches and connections are
flushed, and capacity shifts abruptly. The result can be a larger incident than
the original localized problem.
</p>

<p>
This happens because existing tools lack a way to scope safety actions precisely:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>they act globally rather than locally,</li>
  <li>they lack a clear model of blast radius,</li>
  <li>they treat every change as all-or-nothing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What is needed is the ability to apply corrections in the right zone and at the
right scale, without punishing unrelated parts of the system. Runtime safety
should be scoped, not global.

RCP focuses on scoped runtime corrections instead of blunt, system-wide reactions.
