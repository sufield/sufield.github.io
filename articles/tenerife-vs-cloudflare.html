        <p>On March 27, 1977, two Boeing 747s collided on the runway in Tenerife, killing 583 people. The cause? An ambiguous radio transmission that was interpreted differently by the pilot and air traffic control.</p>

<p>On November 12, 2025, Cloudflare's global edge network went dark for 4 hours. The cause? An ambiguous configuration propagation state that was interpreted differently by control plane and data plane.</p>
<h2>Tenerife: &quot;We Are Now at Takeoff&quot;</h2>
<p>The KLM captain radioed: &quot;We are now at takeoff.&quot;</p>
<p>Did that mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We are currently taking off&quot; (in progress)?</li>
<li>&quot;We are at the takeoff position&quot; (waiting)?</li>
</ul>
<p>Air traffic control interpreted it as the latter. The captain meant the former. 583 people died.</p>
<h2>Cloudflare 2025: &quot;Config Propagation Complete&quot;</h2>
<p>The edge orchestrator received: &quot;Config propagation complete.&quot;</p>
<p>Did that mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes have acknowledged receipt?</li>
<li>All nodes have applied and validated the config?</li>
<li>All nodes are serving traffic with the new config?</li>
</ul>
<p>The control plane assumed all three. Only the first was true. The internet went dark.</p>
<h2>Aviation's Solution: Standard Phraseology</h2>
<p>After Tenerife, aviation made ambiguous communication <strong>impossible</strong>. Every phase of flight has exact, unambiguous phrases:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Cleared for takeoff&quot; (not &quot;at takeoff&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;Holding short&quot; (not &quot;waiting&quot;)</li>
<li>&quot;Ready for departure&quot; (not &quot;ready to go&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren't suggestions. They're requirements. Violating them is a safety violation.</p>
<h2>Cloud's Non-Solution: &quot;Best Practices&quot;</h2>
<p>Cloud providers publish &quot;best practices&quot; for safe config propagation. But they're optional. The control plane still accepts ambiguous states. The deployment pipeline still allows implicit assumptions.</p>
<p>When those assumptions break — and they always do — we get global cascading outages.</p>
<h2>The Pattern Is Identical</h2>
<p><strong>Tenerife taught us</strong>: In safety-critical systems, ambiguity kills.</p>
<p><strong>Cloud providers in 2025</strong>: Still operating with ambiguous state machines, implicit contracts, and &quot;usually works&quot; assumptions.</p>
<p>Aviation fixed this in 1977. We're still debugging the same class of failure 48 years later.</p>

        <p>The technology to make ambiguous states impossible exists. We choose not to use it.</p>
